    Elevator Pitch
    ==============

    BindingJS is a stand-alone MPL-licensed Open Source library
    for JavaScript, providing a powerful View Data Binding for
    User-Interface (UI) dialogs of HTML5-based Rich Clients (aka
    Single-Page-Apps). It is jQuery based, Model agnostic, Reactive and
    Separable.

    Installing
    ==========

    Building
    ========

    The BindingJS build process is based on Grunt. The following Unix
    tools have to be installed for this. The BindingJS author uses an
    OpenPKG-based software-stack for this.

    Mandatory
    ---------

    - Node [node, npm]
      http://nodejs.org/
      (for the run-time of Grunt)

    - Grunt [grunt]
      http://gruntjs.com/
      (for executing the individual build steps)

    Optional
    --------

    - GNU Make [make]
      http://www.gnu.org/software/shtool/
      (for using the convenient build targets in Makefile)

    Continuous Integration
    ======================

    On each change, the BindingJS sources are automatically built and the regression
    test suite run on the Travis Continous Integration (CI) service. The latest
    build status can be found under https://travis-ci.org/rse/bindingjs
