Elevator Pitch
==============

BindingJS is a stand-alone MPL-licensed Open Source library
for JavaScript, providing a powerful View Data Binding for
User-Interface (UI) dialogs of HTML5-based Rich Clients (aka
Single-Page-Apps). It is jQuery based, Model agnostic, Reactive and
Separable.

Installing
==========

Building
========

The BindingJS build process is based on Grunt. The following Unix
tools have to be installed for this. The BindingJS author uses an
OpenPKG-based software-stack for this.

Mandatory
---------

- Node [node, npm]<br/>
  http://nodejs.org/<br/>
  (for the run-time of Grunt)

- Grunt [grunt]<br/>
  http://gruntjs.com/<br/>
  (for executing the individual build steps)

Optional
--------

- GNU Make [make]<br/>
  http://www.gnu.org/software/shtool/<br/>
  (for using the convenient build targets in Makefile)

Continuous Integration
======================

On each change, the BindingJS sources are automatically built and the regression
test suite run on the Travis Continous Integration (CI) service. The latest
build status can be found under https://travis-ci.org/rse/bindingjs
